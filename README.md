# Task-1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

**Objective:**  
Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure and potential vulnerabilities.

## üß∞ Tools Used

- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html) ‚Äì for network scanning
- [Wireshark (optional)](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) ‚Äì for packet analysis

## üìù Task Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Nmap

- Download from: [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html)
- **Linux Installation:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nmap

‚úÖ Step 2: Find Your Local IP Range

  **Linux/Mac:**
  ```bash
    Run ifconfig or ip a
  ```
  Example:
    If your IP is 192.168.1.10 and subnet is 255.255.255.0, your network range is 192.168.1.0/24

‚úÖ Step 3: Run Nmap TCP SYN Scan
```bash
  nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
  ```
  -sS = TCP SYN scan (fast and stealthy)

  *To save results in text format:*
  ```bash
    nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt
```
‚úÖ Step 4: Analyze the Output
Review discovered:
  IP addresses
  Open ports
  Services (e.g., HTTP, SSH)

‚úÖ Step 5: Research Common Services
| Port | Service | Description             | Risk Level                |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 21   | FTP     | File Transfer Protocol  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Insecure (unencrypted) |
| 22   | SSH     | Secure Shell            | ‚úÖ Secure if configured    |
| 23   | Telnet  | Remote login (obsolete) | ‚ùå Deprecated, insecure    |
| 80   | HTTP    | Web (unencrypted)       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unencrypted traffic    |
| 443  | HTTPS   | Secure Web (SSL/TLS)    | ‚úÖ Secure                  |
